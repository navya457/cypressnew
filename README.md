Discription :
Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that doesn't use Selenium at all. It is built on top of Mocha, which is again a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fast.

Requirements:
The JavaScript Templates script has zero dependencies.

PreCondition :
Node should be installed in the System.

Command for installation:
npm install cypress.
